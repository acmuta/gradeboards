Dear Registrarâ€™s Office,

I hope this message finds you well, my name is **INSERT YOUR NAME HERE**, and I am writing this on behalf of the Association for Computing Machinery at UTA (ACM). We are looking to access the grade distribution records and data for the purpose of designing a website to display these statistics, enhancing academic transparency and aiding students in course selection through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

We would like to request data on grade distributions for the following semesters: **INSERT EACH SEMESTER (Spring/Summer/Fall) INDIVIDUALLY HERE**

The specific data we are looking for are as follows. Note that the data should follow this exact csv format: 
- Academic Year

- Subject
- Catalog Number
- Section Number
- A
- B
- C
- D
- F
- I
- P
- Q
- W

An example row of the csv data we are looking for is as follows:
